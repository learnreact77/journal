Established these React facts from wikipedia page
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(software)

Use case:
To create single page applications (SPAs) 
with the help of Next.js

Ambition: 
to allow more seamless building of 
websites based on components.

Scope/Concern: 
is only concerned with rendering of 
components to the screen.
Relies on external libraries for 
things like routing*

Chief advantage:
Only triggers re-render actions on 
screen elements that have changed - avoiding
full-page reloads.

Developed by:
Meta/Facebook. Now open source.

Architecture:


*routing: this is concerned with the navigation of networks.
The concern with React is page routing, since react does not include it.
Given a path /street/house/room, navigation works from the street node 
down the room node. 
In a multi-page applcation this path would map onto a folder
structure with pages as html files.
In single page applications, we need to control this virtually 
by defining a set of routes.
Among other things this solves the problem of controlling the 
behavior of browser navigation, including 
the behaviour of forward/back buttons.
In a single page app (SPA) such as 
are created with React, where few 'full page 
reloads' take place, it becomes necessary 
to take control of page routing.
In React, page routing is typically provided by React Router:

 - investigate build options from github, 
 eg 'Git pages'

 - investigate Next.js

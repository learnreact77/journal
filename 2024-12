Established these React facts

Used:
To create single page applications (SPAs) 
with the help of Next.js

Ambition: 
to allow more seamless building of 
websites based on components.

Scope/Concern: 
is only concerned with rendering of 
components to the screen.
Relies on external libraries for 
things like routing*

Chief advantage:
Only triggers re-render actions on 
screen elements that have changed - avoiding
full-page reloads.

Developed by:
Meta/Facebook. Now open source.

*routing: this is about controlling the 
behavior of browser navigation, including 
the behaviour of forward/back buttons.
In a single page app (SPA) such as 
are created with React, where few 'full page 
reloads' take place, it becomes necessary 
to take control of routing.

 - investigate build options from github, 
 eg 'Git pages'

 - investigate Next.js
